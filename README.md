The **Vulnerability-Toolkit** is an open source library that provides modelling of multi-degree-of-freedom systems and assessment via nonlinear time-history analyses for vulnerability and risk calculations. The **Vulnerability-Toolkit** is developed by the **[GEM](http://www.globalquakemodel.org)** (Global Earthquake Model) Foundation and its collaborators.

## Current Features

* MDOF Modelling: Model single- and multi-degree-of-freedom system using low-level information (e.g., number of storeys, first-mode transformation factor, SDoF- or storey-based force-deformation relationships);
* Modal analysis: Estimate periods of vibration and modal shapes;
* Static analysis: Perform gravity, static and cyclic pushover analyses;
* Dynamic analysis: Perform cloud analysis;
* Regression analysis: Perform regression analysis on cloud analysis data to characterise EDP|IM relationship;
* Fragility analysis: Calculate median seismic intensities, associated dispersion (i.e., record-to-record and modelling uncertainties) and the corresponding probabilities of damage based on demand-based thresholds;
* Vulnerability analysis: Perform fragility function convolution with with consequence models  for structural, and building contents and region-specific non-structural storey-loss functions;
* Plotting: Plot analysis outputs such as model overview, cloud analysis results, demand profiles (i.e., peak storey drifts and peak floor acceleration along the height of the model), fragility functions. Additionally, it is possible to animate the MDoF considering a single run;
