The **Vulnerability-Toolkit** is an open source library that provides modelling of multi-degree-of-freedom systems and assessment via nonlinear time-history analyses for vulnerability and risk calculations. The **Vulnerability-Toolkit** is developed by the **[GEM](http://www.globalquakemodel.org)** (Global Earthquake Model) Foundation and its collaborators.

## Current Features

* Modelling of building class-representative stick-and-mass model using low-level information
* Modal analysis
* Static analysis: gravity, static and cyclic pushover analyses
* Dynamic analysis: Cloud analysis using built-in or user-specific sets of ground-motions records
* Regression analysis: Characterisation of IM-EDP relationship following cloud analyses
* Fragility analysis: Calculation of damage probabilities
* Vulnerability analysis: Integration with region-specific vulnerability models for structural, non-structural and building contents
* Plotting: model overview and demand profiles (i.e., peak storey drifts and peak floor acceleration along the height of the model)
